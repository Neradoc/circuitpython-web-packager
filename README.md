How to use the Web Workflow
===========================

- Get all the files locally.
- Start a server on localhost in the repository's directory.
- Connect to `/workflow.html` on that server.

You need a board with the web workflow enabled ! [See docs here](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/blob/main/docs/workflows.md#web).

Start a server ?
----------------

Easy, call that from the command line while in the repository's directory:
```sh
python -m http.server
```
And connect to [http://localhost:8000/workflow.html](http://localhost:8000/workflow.html).
